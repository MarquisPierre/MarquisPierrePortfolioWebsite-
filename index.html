        <h3> About Me</h3>
        <p> My name is Marquis Pierre and I have intrest in many things like anime, manga, and music. I never really got deep into coding because I found it quite a difficult task, but a year later I've gotten a deep intrest for it. I didn't know there were so many programming languages! Getting off of the topic of coding; I like to play the guitar and listen to loud music. I also have an interest in learning diffrent languages like Japanese and French, so on my free time I like to learn them. I also like to draw for fun on my free time. I love obtaining new hobbies because it allows me to say "I have a life".
        Currently I am self studying programming languages to become a web deveolper in the near future.

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p> I am currently a student at BMCC trying to get an assosiate degree in Multimedia Programming and Design. I might plan to transfer to Lehman college simply because it is a 20 minute bus ride from my house and to change my major to computer science most likely.</p>

     <div id="skills">
       <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p> I don't have a lot of skills in my opinion but I know the essentials of a couple of adobe softwares like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premeire Pro, and adobe XD. I also understand the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.</p>
